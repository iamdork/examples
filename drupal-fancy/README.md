# Fancy Drupal setup

A more sophisticated example of how to run Drupal with `dork-compose`. It assumes that projects are based on the [drupal composer template](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project) and will do a full setup during `dork-compose up`. Various settings are handled with [environment variables](.env), which can be overridden per project or instance.
